/*
Note:
- The 'amount' for each level is taken from the 'provide' value determined in the previous step (which was the per-member contribution from the 'Team' column in the image).
- The 'sponsorShare' is assumed to be a fixed 100 for all levels, following the pattern observed in your original LEVELS_CONFIG.
- The 'receiverShare' is calculated as 'amount - sponsorShare'.
- 'description' is a generic "Level X Activation".
